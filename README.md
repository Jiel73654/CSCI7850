# Project
This project presents applying residual physical neural networks (Res-PINN) to identify the parameters of the time-dependent Susceptible-Infectious-Remove (SIR) model by using deep neural networks. The data are the number of cases of infected, recovered, and deceased cases in New York, from March30 to August 30.
