# Project
This project presents applying residual physical neural networks (Res-PINN) to identify the parameters of the time-dependent Susceptible-Infectious-Remove (SIR) model by using deep neural networks. The data are the number of cases of infected, recovered, and deceased cases in New York, from March30 to August 30.
The TensorFlow 1.x version was utilized in this project. Considering the potential issues of different version of TensorFlow, the identified parameters, beta and gamma, were generated as CVS files.
